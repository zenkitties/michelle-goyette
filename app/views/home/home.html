    <p>I'm excited to announce my first public audience reading of 2019!<br /><br />
        For those who bring a gift certificate and donate to families who have been displaced from the Paradise and Camp fires, your names will be entered into a drawing to win a FREE private reading with me. I will be drawing TWO names for this donation. Acceptable gift cards for Target or Walmart only to make it easier to detect honest active amounts on the cards. I am working closely with a trusted friend to ensure the gift cards go directly to those families in need who are literally starting over after loosing their homes to the awful fires. Seating is limited to first come first serve. No admission at the door.
